Git Branching Exercise

1) git checkout -b
2) fast-forward merge is when there's a linear path from the master to the branch being merged into it;
	the merge has one parent
   recursive merge is when there are new commits on the master which have occured *after* the branch in question;
	the merge has two parents
3) git checkout [name of branch]
4) git branch -d [name of branch]
	or for forced deletion
   git branch -D [name of branch]
5) when the two parents being merged have code segments which differ and directly conflict;
	this is flagged by git but must be resolved by the (human) programmer
